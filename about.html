    <p class="darth2">Jax Fray is something i do in my free time, its an organzation for
        adults to play various sport together. I join because i wanted to be
        social, and i have going to the gym. The league is great and ive met
        alot of new people. I've been playing for 3 years now but it felt like
        a week honestly. I recommend it everyone i met, flag football is my cup of
        tea but they have a huge variety.

    <p>I started dog walker when i was a junior in
        highschool, at first it was just a way to make 
        money when i wasnt in school. I started to depend
        on these animal as much as they depended on me, 
        i just love the felling you get when a dog is so excited
        to see you that they cant control their body. These are 
        3 of my favorite dog, Shea and Gerogia are the dogs on the
        left, Snickers is the one on the right.
